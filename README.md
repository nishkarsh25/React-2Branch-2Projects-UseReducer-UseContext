## Technologies Used

- **React**: A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows for the creation of reusable components, making it easy to manage complex UIs.
- **React Context API**: Used to manage global state across components. The shopping cart state is stored in a context provider, making it accessible to all components in the application.
- **useState Hook**: React hook for managing state in functional components.
- **Components**: Modular building blocks used to compose the UI, including Navbar, Shop, Cart, and Card components.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of pre-built classes to style your application. Tailwind CSS allows for rapid development and consistent styling.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: The latest version of JavaScript is used to write the application logic. ES6+ features such as arrow functions, destructuring, and spread syntax are utilized to write clean and concise code.
